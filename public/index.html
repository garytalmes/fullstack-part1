  <h1>Fullstack Explorer Part I</h1>

  <p>With your teammates, take a look at the source code running this site and see if you can answer the questions below. Some of these questions may require some Googling!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How is the form on the <a href="contact">contact page</a> sending data to the server?</li>
    <li>Where in the server.js file is that form data being received?</li>
    <li>When the form data is received, what is the first thing the code checks for? And what does it do if that check fails?</li>
    <li>In some of the response code you will see <code>res.status</code>. What does that do?</li>
    <li>If the user submits valid data, what are we doing with that data?</li>
    <li>Notice that the readFile and writeFile methods are being called differently than you may have seen before? What's up with that?</li>
    <li>What logic am I using to generate the name of the file which is written by the server?</li>
    <li>How are we handling the result that the server sends back to the contact form after submission?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you finish early, try any of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Add another field to the contact form and make sure that data is also written to the file on the server.</li>
    <li>Write a catch-all route in case someone tries to go to a page that doesn't exist.</li>
    <li>Create another html page and a route which will serve it. When the page hits the browser, it should also load a Javascript file. That Javascript file should make a GET request back to the server for some data. Check the data folder in the server code. Can you grab that data, send it to the browser, and have the browser display it?</li>
  </ul>
